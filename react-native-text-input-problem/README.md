To reproduce the issue:
 
1. Run the application in Expo (using `npm start`).
2. Put the cursor to the beginning of the entered text (do not delete the text itself).
3. Try to type something.

Expected: you see the text that you just typed. Actual: the text you typed is hidden by the left side of the input.
